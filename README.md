## cis352-p0
### Project 0 for CIS352
First project in CIS352: Programming Language and Theory. Tasked with implementing functions for Tic-Tac-Toe using Racket lists. The last function "calculate-next-move" is for an 'Excellent' mark on the project and is an implementation of a computer AI to play against the user. The AI uses the Mini-Max alogrithm to calculate the next move such that the computer cannot lose the game.
